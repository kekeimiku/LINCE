> Memory dynamic pointer chain (scan/backtrack/search) tool.

## Features:

It contains three tools: 

- `ptrsx-scan` for scanning pointer files.

- `ptrsx-dumper` is used to dump process memory. 

- `ptrsx-inject` for dynamic library injection.

## Support:

- [x] x86_64-linux

- [x] aarch64-darwin

- [ ] aarch64-android

- [ ] nintendo-switch

- [ ] x86_64-windows

Currently, it is only tested on 64-bit systems and 64-bit targets. Although it can be compiled to other architectures, it cannot run normally. Support for 32-bit targets and other operating systems is in progress.
